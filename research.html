        <p> My research with the Colby Physics department during my undergrad career centers around this
            phenomena known as Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (<abbr>EIT</abbr>). EIT is the phenomena in which 
            a medium, usually a vapor, is rendered transparent due to the interference between two lasers and
            the medium's energy levels. Essentially, two lasers are pointed towards a medium, one laser is 
            resonant with one of the medium's energy levels (call it intermediate state), and a second laser
            is resonant with a different energy level of the medium (call it excited state), but
            it scans through different wavelengths. When the first laser is the only laser in resonance, the 
            electrons in the medium are pumped from its ground state to its intermediate state. When both lasers
            are in resonance, the electrons are pumped from the intermediate state to the excited state leaving
            the intermediate state empty. When this happens, the absorption of the first later decreases significantly
            rendering the medium transparent to the first laser.

        </figure>

        <p> My research on EIT was mostly focused on the computational modeling of our experiment. I was also
            focused on improving the experiment's quality so that we can collect publish-worthy datasets and
            start making isotope shift measurements of potassium. Although the experiments were really fun 
            I personally enjoyed the computational aspect of the project. In order to model our experiment,
            we would need to solve a system of coupled differential equations. The dimensionality of the differential
            equations depends on the number of states. At the minimum, we must have three states, which results in a 
            system of 9 differential equations; in order to fully simulate our experiment, we would need to have a total
            of 24 states, which will result 576 coupled differential equations. Through some neat analysis we managed to
            break down this problem into a matrix problem in which we would only need to solve a simple matrix equation, the 
            only issue is that this matrix would be an n<sup>2</sup> by n<sup>2</sup> matrix which can lead to human error, not
            to mention that typing in a matrix that big would be a pain.
        </p> <br>

        <p> My initial solution to this matrix problem was to create a program that will handle the analysis and output the required
            matrix as lambda function in Python. During the 2021 Fall semester, I improved that system so that the matrix will be
            written in C++. This was to improve the speed of our calculations and to also experiment with different computational methods.
            Currently I am using a sparse matrix to model our experiment, but there are other methods that we can work with. 
        </p><br>

        <p> The following code is from the library I developed for this project. The method is called the 
            <code>superOperatorElements</code> method, and it calculates elements of the super-operator matrix.
            This matrix is responsible for taking into account the decay rates between energy levels within the 
            medium (see figure 1).
